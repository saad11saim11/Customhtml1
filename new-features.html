                            If your business is required to make high volumes of payments this can
                            become very time- consuming if your chosen payment provider does not have
                            the appropriate technology to accommodate your requirements. Add the
                            complexities of multiple currencies and different jurisdictions the process can
                            become even more challenging
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Batch Payments with Central FX enable clients to make multiple payments
                            under one single instruction. Whether you want to make payments on the fly,
                            save and come back later or copy from a previous instruction, building a
                            payment run is fast, simple, and cost-effective.
                        </p>

                            instruction. This gives users the ability to build a quote across various currency pairs and
                            tenors reducing the administrative burden of booking multiple deals.
